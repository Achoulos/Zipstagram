A simple node app to download your Instagram likes

#To Run Locally

Simply clone the repository, add your Instagram client/client secret keys to the lib/secret.js file, <code>npm init</code> then  <code>node app.js</code>, and you should be good to go!

#About

This is my first solo project and my first node.js application. I would appreciate any feedback or corrections to my newbie code!

#todo

1. fix inline styling
2. figure out why instagram occasionally doesn't return ALL liked photos
3. add flash notifications on authentication/switch to jade templates
4. implement legit pagination instead of passing in <code>-1</code> as the <code>count</code> parameter.
